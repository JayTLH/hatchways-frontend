# Hatchways Front-end Assessment - Student Profiles
Created by Jason Huang

In this assessment, I made a simple front-end application using React.js with data from Hatchways' own API. It is set to run on PORT = 3030

## Info
The app displays a list of student information that provides name, email, picture, etc. Each student component can be expanded and collapsed to reveal more information on grades for each test. After expanding, the user can also add tags to the student for additional identifiers.

There are two search bars that will filter the number of students on display. One is done by name which will pull up the results from both first and last names. The other is done by tags which will pull up all results with the corresponding tag. When both searches are filled in, it will pull results from both queries.
